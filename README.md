ABSTRACT

CBMS application mainly has three aspects Students, Faculty and Admin. Basically, the journey of a student starts from creating an account where they can mention their area of interest. After few clicks, they can find their peer group with similar interests, projects and even find faculty who are specialized in that particular field and therefore can find a way to improve their practical knowledge and  also get into a like-minded community. Faculty can get to know curious students and help them in projects and also encourage them to be a part of their research. Admins can know the details of completed and ongoing projects. They can even add filters to students according to requirements.
